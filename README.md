The following text (which is a README file) gives some information about the project.

# Who are we?

We are an informal group of people, based in a small mountain town in northern Italy, who are passionate about everything digital and who think it is important that access to the digital world does not remain a privilege of a few people.

In our town, in recent years, we have seen the arrival of many migrants (mainly from Africa and Asia) who were escaping violence and poverty. Now, they are trying to begin a new life in Italy, getting an education if they need to and looking for jobs.

Most of them come from deprived backgrounds and received little or no formal education. But it's hard to find a job if you don't have the skills! So, starting from this consideration, we decided to help them gain some digital skills (e.g. how to use a word processor, how to navigate the Internet and do an effective search, how to send files ..)

# What are we doing?

We are organizing digital skills courses for low-educated migrants who recently arrived in our community (in Italy).

Various editions of the course have been carried out since 2016, but this is the first time we, the teachers, try to **systematise and share** the materials we use.

# What is non-formal education?

Basically, it is a way of teaching that does not require the teacher to stand in front of the class and give a lecture, but that rather involves a lot of practical activities that require the students to do, act, moving around, play games in team .. In this way, it is much easier to overcome lanaguge and cultural barriers and the students learn much more!

Our digital skills courses are based on this principles.

# What is this place?

This place is a **repository** (it is a bit like a shared folder everyone can contribute to and download the materials from) that contains curricula, syllabi and especially materials to do classroom activities of an ongoing digital literacy course for **low-educated asylum seekers and migrants**.

# How can you get involved?

It is a lot of work to come up with new teaching materials and to make them!

We are looking for teachers or tech entusiasts who are willing to create simple materials and put them online.

You will find an example of the type of subjects the materials should address here

(An example is: how do I teach my class that a browser is a kind of software (we've covered what software is in a previous lesson) and that there are many browsers out there (for example Firefox, Chrome, Safari ..) that do one and the same thing (i.e. enablig you to surf the Internet?)
