## What should I know before I get started?
Culturabinaria is a project aimed at gathering teaching materials that have been created during a basic literacy course aimed at low-schooled refugees and asylum seekers, and to create new ones.

To know more about the project, go here [link to the readme]

## What is this website?
Github is a website that offers a platform that makes it easy when several people have to collaborate on the same thing -- in our case, people creating materials for a basic digital skills course.

(Github is based on a software called Git, but that's too long a story for now :-))

In order to contribute to this project, you have to create an account on GitHub first.

## How can I contribute?
You can help us creating the teaching materials that are still uncovered.

You can find a list here. [link to isses] Every item that we need is called an "issue".

Once you decide what you want to work on, you can assign the issue to yourself by clicking on the top right corner.

Then, you can start creating, and then upload your materials wherever you want in the lessons: click here for a basic explanation of how to do it.

To know (more or less) what are the topics of each lesson, please refer to the programs (link to the programs).

If your material is aimed for an intermediate class (ie can be used with somebody who have already used a computer), put it under "corso-avanzato" (link). If it is aimed for a basic class (ie can be used with people who have hardly seen a computer before and are just starting), put it under "corso-base".

## It's too hard, can't I just send you the files?
If you find this is too hard and would prefer not to use GitHub, you can also send the materials via e-mail to Martina, the creator of this repository and one of the teachers of the digital literacy courses. Her e-mail is martina dot puppi at indie dot host.

## Styleguide
Our lessons are based on non-formal education, and the teaching materials should reflect that.

This means that the teaching materials should be mostly in form of games, group activities, and off-line exercises.
